	abstract = {To help public health practitioners promote physical activities with a low risk of injury, this study determined the relation among type and duration of physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and musculoskeletal injury in a sample of adults enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study. Subjects included 4,034 men and 967 women who underwent a baseline physical examination between 1970 and 1985 and who returned a mailed follow-up survey in 1986. At baseline, a treadmill graded exercise test was used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. At follow-up, subjects reported injuries and type and duration of physical activity in the preceding 12 months. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate the association among physical activity type and duration, cardiorespiratory fitness, and injury. The risk of sustaining an activity-related injury increased with higher duration of physical activity per week and cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Results suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness may be a surrogate for unmeasured components of physical activity, such as exercise intensity. Among walkers, increasing duration of activity per week was not associated with an increased risk of injury. Results suggest that, for most adults, walking is a safe form of physical activity associated with a lower risk of injury than running or sport participation.},

Many transport researchers have overlooked these data, which is the motivation for and purpose of this paper. A number of considerations need to be taken into account when using TUS data, particularly in relation to analysis, which is rather specialised. We compare TUS and activity-travel diaries from transport and report on travel behaviour using data from the 2014-2015 UK Time Use Survey (UK TUS) and highlight additional data that are available, such as secondary activities and levels of enjoyment associated with travel. The results show that one in four travel episodes included secondary and tertiary activities, the most common being listening to music and radio, socialising with family and others, telephone conversations and reading. Using ICT (smartphone, tablet, computer, etc.) was reported in 11.3\% of travel episodes and 26.9\% of the time respondents felt rushed while travelling. In terms of enjoyment, longer travel episodes were associated with lower levels of enjoyment, active travel was the most enjoyable and commuting the least. Commuting episodes were the longest, followed by social and personal business, at least 1-2 min longer than travel episodes for escorting children and others, or for shopping.},

Is society polarizing into groups which, on one side, have too much work and too little leisure time to spend their money in, and on the other have no paid work, and hence no money to pay for the goods and services they might wish to use during their leisure? Has the recent convergence in men's and women's labour market roles led to an unfair distribution of the totals of paid plus unpaid work? These issues, and others similar, once the preserve of a few specialist sociologists and economists, now appear daily and prominently across the news and entertainment media. Yet there is surprisingly little substantive evidence of how individuals and societies spend their time, and of how this has changed in the developed world over the recent past. This book brings together, for the first time, data gathered in some forty national scale 'time-diary' studies, from twenty countries, and covering the last third of the twentieth century. It examines the newly emerging political economy of time, in the light of new estimates of how time is actually spent, and of how this has changed, in the developed world.},

The paper examines the influence of the survey instrument on recall by comparing reported travel behaviour in two surveys conducted in the same town, one using a conventional travel diary and the other an activity diary. The latter format appears to encourage a more complete response, giving rise to significantly higher reported trip rates and travel times.

  abstract = {An in-depth understanding of travel behaviour determinants, including the relationship to non-travel activities, is the foundation for modelling and policy making. National Travel Surveys (NTS) and time use surveys (TUS) are two major data sources for travel behaviour and activity participation. The aim of this paper is to systematically compare both survey types regarding travel activities and non-travel activities. The analyses are based on the German National Travel Survey and the German National Time Use Survey from 2002. The number of trips and daily travel time for mobile respondents were computed as the main travel estimates. The number of trips per person is higher in the German TUS when changes in location without a trip are included. Location changes without a trip are consecutive non-trip activities with different locations but without a trip in-between. The daily travel time is consistently higher in the German TUS. The main reason for this difference is the 10-min interval used. Differences in travel estimates between the German TUS and NTS result from several interaction effects. Activity time in NTS is comparable with TUS for subsistence activities. Our analyses confirm that both survey types have advantages and disadvantages. TUS provide reliable travel estimates. The number of trips even seems preferable to NTS if missed trips are properly identified and considered. Daily travel times are somewhat exaggerated due to the 10-min interval. The fixed time interval is the most important limitation of TUS data. The result is that trip times in TUS do not represent actual trip times very well and should be treated with caution. We can use NTS activity data for subsistence activities between the first trip and the last trip. This can potentially benefit activity-based approaches since most activities before the first trip and after the last trip are typical home-based activities which are rarely substituted by out-of-home activities.},

  abstract = {Grocery shopping episodes are often grouped with other shopping in travel surveys, making it difficult to study these activities. This paper explores grocery shopping trips, shopping episode characteristics and participants, and assesses the potential loss of information stemming from the grouping of all shopping activities. A sample of metropolitan area respondent data from the Canadian General Social Surveys' 2010 and 2015 (cycles 24 and 29) time use modules is used. In the 2010 survey, grocery shopping and other shopping is surveyed separately, while the 2015 survey merges all shopping activities. This provides an opportunity to compare these approaches. The characteristics of shopping activities (2010 and 2015) with respect to participation, timing, in-store episode time and trip duration, activity sequences (in-store episodes with access/egress trips), and respondents' demographics are compared using bivariate tests, and logistic regressions. Activity sequences are assessed using two locations before and two locations after shopping episodes. Grocery shopping activity sequences are shorter in duration than other shopping activity sequences. No difference in episode duration is found between gender or income for groceries, while significant differences are found for other shopping. ``Home-store-home'' by car is the most frequent sequence for all shopping types. Nearly half of the grocery shopping activity sequence is spent on the access and egress trips. In logistic regressions, age, gender, employment, and the most frequent travel mode are associated with having performed shopping episodes, regardless of shopping types. Compared to other shopping episodes, grocery shopping is more strongly associated with being 75 or older, being married, from visible minority groups, and with higher education. Grocery shopping activities differ from other shopping in terms of participant, timing, duration, and activity sequence. Combining grocery shopping and other shopping in future time use surveys (and in travel surveys) may mask the distinctiveness of grocery shopping episodes, trips and overall sequences.},

  abstract = {Trip chaining is a phenomenon that we know exists but rarely investigate. This could be attributed to either the difficulty in defining trip chains, extracting such information from travel diary surveys, the difficulty in analysing all the possible trip chain types, or all of the above. Household travel diary surveys provide a wealth of information on the travel patterns of individuals and households. Since such surveys collect all information related to travel undertaken, in theory it should be possible to extract trip-chaining characteristics of travel from them. Due to the difficulty in establishing and analysing all of the possible trip chain types, the majority of research on trip chaining has appeared to focus on work travel only. However, work related travel in many cities does not represent the majority of activities undertaken and, for some age groups, does not represent any travel at all. This paper begins by reviewing existing research in the field of trip chaining. In particular, investigations into the definitions of trip chaining, the defined typologies of trip chains and the research questions that have been addressed are explored. This review of previous research into trip chaining facilitates the following tasks: the identification of the most useful questions to be addressed by this research; defining trip chaining and associated typologies and defining data structures to extract trip chaining information from the household travel surveys conducted in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. The definition and typology developed in our research was then used to extract trip-chaining information from the household travel diary survey (MAHTS99) conducted in Adelaide in 1999. The extracted trip chaining information was then used to investigate trip-chaining behaviour by households. The paper reports the results of this analysis and concludes with a summary of the findings and recommendations for further investigations.},

  abstract = {The distance decay function has been attracting attention in diverse disciplines including transportation studies, spatial planning and urban geography. In particular, much discussion has concentrated on the measurement of distance decay on the regional scale, since the emphasis of the model utilisation has been on explaining interregional mobility (mainly commuting). The intra-urban context makes the estimation more complicated and the fundamental questions, such as how far people travel within the city to reach a variety of urban destinations, and whether there are potentially significant differences between these types of destinations, are still not answered in a satisfactory way. In response to this challenge, the paper attempts to reveal the spatial variations of the distance decay effect on movements in urban space through the utilisation of mobile phone data. The signalling data from all major mobile network operators in Slovakia represent new opportunities with high accuracy of measurement and complexity of representation. The methodological procedure for deriving data about human daily movements from the mobile network at the level of 1~\texttimes ~1 km statistical grid cells is presented. The objective is to estimate the appropriate distance decay functions for urban grids and demonstrate the variation of decay curves within the Bratislava city. The findings relativise the decay law of human mobility. For the approximation of daily mobility within the urban area, the polynomial-exponential function -- the decreasing function with a small increase of interaction intensity at a greater distance -- describes the impedance of travel distance more preferably. However, a significant proportion of urban grids have recorded weak or even no decay. A question worth investigating is whether the resulting friction of distance is a result of a specific functional structure of the study area, or it could reflect an advanced stage of urban evolution.},

  abstract = {The concept of `distance decay' curves is used in spatial interaction and accessibility analysis to represent the diminishing likelihood of visiting places with increasing travel impedance, mainly distance and travel time. The shape of the resulting impedance decay curves varies by several factors, but these influential factors are often dismissed in favor of just travel mode. In this study, we examine which factors should be used to distinguish impedance functions for use. Using data from a large national travel survey, we first show that the impedance curves are well approximated by functions of the exponential family and the related Tanner function. We use two methods -- variable-wise function fit and Shapley additive explanations -- to conclude the importance of four factors for developing impedance functions. These are travel mode, trip purpose, urbanity class of trip origin and destination, and the socioeconomic status grouping of the travelers. We then show that the use of a generalized impedance function can significantly over- or underestimate spatial accessibility compared to factor-specific impedance function, with up to 80~\% overestimation on average in the case of public transit and 16~\% overestimation for low socio-economic status travelers. These findings highlight the importance of the choice of impedance function which has applications in spatial economics, transportation planning, and human mobility analyses.},
