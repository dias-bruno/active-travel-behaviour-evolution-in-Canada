	abstract = {To help public health practitioners promote physical activities with a low risk of injury, this study determined the relation among type and duration of physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and musculoskeletal injury in a sample of adults enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study. Subjects included 4,034 men and 967 women who underwent a baseline physical examination between 1970 and 1985 and who returned a mailed follow-up survey in 1986. At baseline, a treadmill graded exercise test was used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. At follow-up, subjects reported injuries and type and duration of physical activity in the preceding 12 months. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate the association among physical activity type and duration, cardiorespiratory fitness, and injury. The risk of sustaining an activity-related injury increased with higher duration of physical activity per week and cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Results suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness may be a surrogate for unmeasured components of physical activity, such as exercise intensity. Among walkers, increasing duration of activity per week was not associated with an increased risk of injury. Results suggest that, for most adults, walking is a safe form of physical activity associated with a lower risk of injury than running or sport participation.},

Many transport researchers have overlooked these data, which is the motivation for and purpose of this paper. A number of considerations need to be taken into account when using TUS data, particularly in relation to analysis, which is rather specialised. We compare TUS and activity-travel diaries from transport and report on travel behaviour using data from the 2014-2015 UK Time Use Survey (UK TUS) and highlight additional data that are available, such as secondary activities and levels of enjoyment associated with travel. The results show that one in four travel episodes included secondary and tertiary activities, the most common being listening to music and radio, socialising with family and others, telephone conversations and reading. Using ICT (smartphone, tablet, computer, etc.) was reported in 11.3\% of travel episodes and 26.9\% of the time respondents felt rushed while travelling. In terms of enjoyment, longer travel episodes were associated with lower levels of enjoyment, active travel was the most enjoyable and commuting the least. Commuting episodes were the longest, followed by social and personal business, at least 1-2 min longer than travel episodes for escorting children and others, or for shopping.},
